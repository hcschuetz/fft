This directory contains some FFT implementations in Rust.

Notice that this is just proof-of-concept level and sometimes quite hacky.
I am new to Rust and probably several things can be solved in a far more
elegant/idiomatic way.

Furthermore some code has been "stolen" from `../fft-cpp/`
and might be factored out to one or more utility packages.

But at least we now also have Rust-based versions to compare with.
You can't just ignore Rust in performance investigations for the web.
