# Code performance study based on the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT).

## TL;DR
Test and benchmark the FFT implementations at
https://hcschuetz.github.io/fft/build/.

There are also demo applications using the FFT:
- https://hcschuetz.github.io/fft/build#ClockworkDemo
- https://hcschuetz.github.io/fft/build#AudioDemo

## Overview

This started as a study about efficiency of JavaScript/TypeScript (`./fft-ts/`)
but meanwhile there are also implementations in
- C/C++ (`./fft-cpp/`),
- Rust (`./fft-rust/`), and
- a basic home-grown language (`./fft-mylang`)

for comparison.

See file `versions.md` for more details about the versions.

This project only deals with complex-to-complex FFTs.
